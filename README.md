## Current roadmap

- (currently working on) Refactor the reparser so that I don't want to die every time I look at it and try to make changes to it
- (p0) Re-implement locale support (EN only atm lmao)
- (p0) Refactor tagging so I can implement the next task
- (p1, iterative) FTS lookup and tagging heuristics, including disambiguation
- (p1) Refactor autocomplete index builder so that I don't want to die every time I look at it
- (p2) BinahBot localization (as in, the interface itself, which only supports EN atm)
- (p4) Per-channel spoiler enforcement
- (p1 but ETA is next year) Deck repository
