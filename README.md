Library of Ruina Discord bot

## Contributing

Talk me to me before doing anything. It would suck if you put out a PR only to find out that I decided to change direction

## Current roadmap

- (currently working on) Refactor the reparser so that I don't want to die every time I look at it and try to make changes to it
- ~~(p0) Refactor tagging so I can implement the next task~~
- ~~(p1, iterative) FTS lookup and tagging heuristics, including disambiguation~~
- (p0) Figure out methods to disambiguate that don't solely rely on manual lookup and/or applied heuristic
- (p1) Switch over to fuzzy searching with n-gram, away from fulltext search
- ~~(p1) Refactor autocomplete index builder so that I don't want to die every time I look at it~~
- ~~(p2) BinahBot localization (as in, the interface itself, which only supports EN atm)~~
  - (p3) Localize beyond EN
- (p4) Per-channel spoiler enforcement
- (p1 but ETA is next year) Deck repository
