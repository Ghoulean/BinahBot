# Ruina Reparser

Hack scripts to convert Library of Ruina XML files into an easily digestable format. These scripts are one-off. Don't expect good code here.

First: set up Node 18. Not tested with other versions of node. You can use Node version manager.

1. Download XMLs from BaseMod
2. Put BaseMod folder into root
3. Build `@ghoulean/ruina-common` (should be in the same repo)
4. Build this package via `npm run build`
