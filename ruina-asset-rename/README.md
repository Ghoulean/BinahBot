# ruina-asset-rename

Deprecating this repo in favor of simply ripping correctly-named assets from the game directly.

~~Yet another 1-off subrepo.~~

~~The ripped assets from @Lunartique are named according to their English localizations. This subrepo renames files back to their page IDs.~~

~~Prerequisite: English `queryLookupResults.json` from the reparser needs to be copy/pasted into `/src/`~~
