    Once upon a time, three happy birds lived in a warm and lush forest.
  </param>

  <param key="BigBirdArrive" index="1">
    Big Bird, with its many eyes, decided to watch over the forest for intruders.&#13;&#10;For Big Bird’s eyes could see very far, and see things we cannot see.
  </param>

  <param key="LongBirdArrive" index="3">
    To keep the forest’s peace, Long Bird weighed the sins of those who entered the forest.&#13;&#10;For Long Bird’s scale was fair and just, and could weigh any and all kinds of sin.
  </param>

  <param key="SmallBirdArrive" index="2">
    Small Bird decided to punish the creatures’ wrongdoings with its beak.
  </param>

  <param key="BossBirdAppear" index="4">
    Then, in the middle of all the chaotic cries, someone shouted:&#13;&#10;“It’s the beast! A big, scary monster lives in the black, dusky forest!”
  </param>

  <param key="BigBirdBreak" index="5">
    Big Bird’s far seeing eyes were blinded,
  </param>

  <param key="LongBirdBreak" index="7">
    The head that always gazed upon the cosmos was lowered,
  </param>

  <param key="SmallBirdBreak" index="6">
    Small Bird’s mouth that could devour anything was shut,
  </param>

  <param key="Suppressed" index="8">
    The bird began to prowl the forest, but there was nothing.&#13;&#10;There were no creatures, no sun and moon, and no beast. All that was left was just a bird and the Black Forest.
