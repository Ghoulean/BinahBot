      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_0">What a strange place I’ve ended up seeing.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_1">It’s just as the reports described. It doesn’t quite… feel like a library, though.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_2">I’m seeing familiar uniforms.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_3">Is that how they steal the strength of the guests that have come here…</BattleDialog>
