    <Type ID="START_BATTLE">
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_0">What a cute cluster of adorable little squirts~</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_1">Let us end this at a breath.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_2">If you insist on beating us so badly… Everyone, let us prepare ourselves.</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="BATTLE_VICTORY">
      <BattleDialog ID="BATTLE_VICTORY_0">I hope this taught you a good lesson.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="BATTLE_VICTORY_1">This wouldn’t have happened had you just tucked your tails and surrendered… Sigh, what a pity.</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="DEATH">
      <BattleDialog ID="DEATH_0">If only that bitchhead didn’t interfere with our business…</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH">
      <BattleDialog ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH_0">Tsk. This is the strength of a nebbish who swore to protect me?</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH_1">This won’t do… You haven’t fully served your role yet.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH_2">It seems the situation is headed to a rather worrying direction.</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="KILLS_OPPONENT">
      <BattleDialog ID="KILLS_OPPONENT_0">You should’ve packed up and quit this occupation if you were so inept.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="KILLS_OPPONENT_1">You looked rather impatient~ Were you unnerved, perhaps?</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="KILLS_OPPONENT_2">That was quite underwhelming for such a notorious faction.</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
  </Character>
  <Character ID="Gin">
    <Type ID="START_BATTLE">
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_0">I’ll handle that one.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_1">They don’t appear to be easy opponents.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_2">Even if we’re evenly matched, we should stay alert till the end.</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="BATTLE_VICTORY">
      <BattleDialog ID="BATTLE_VICTORY_0">I’m drained of all my energy after getting into two tough fights in a day.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="BATTLE_VICTORY_1">Let’s head back now. It seems we’ve taken care of them all.</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="DEATH">
      <BattleDialog ID="DEATH_0">…My ineptitude is to blame. I’m sorry about this.</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH">
      <BattleDialog ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH_0">We could’ve avoided dying a dog’s death like this.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH_1">We’ve lost some vigor dealing with that ordeal outside… I suppose we had too little left to handle this one.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH_2">I don’t want to see anyone else fall behind.</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="KILLS_OPPONENT">
      <BattleDialog ID="KILLS_OPPONENT_0">You tried to stop me with such little strength?</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="KILLS_OPPONENT_1">You should’ve known your place.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="KILLS_OPPONENT_2">It’s unfortunate, but it’s time you gave up.</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
  </Character>
  <Character ID="Yang">
    <Type ID="START_BATTLE">
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_0">Hooh~ Man, I’m tired.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_1">When will I get to stop covering myself in dirty bloodstains?</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_2">No good can come from getting flustered like that~</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="BATTLE_VICTORY">
      <BattleDialog ID="BATTLE_VICTORY_0">Now I get why that whelp sent us here. Saw a lot of weird things.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="BATTLE_VICTORY_1">You’re so frail, I can’t stand to watch it.</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="DEATH">
      <BattleDialog ID="DEATH_0">Blast… Do you even know what happens if you treat Kurokumo like this…?</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH">
      <BattleDialog ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH_0">That… was pretty sharp. I’d better watch out for it.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH_1">No way. We’re being overpowered by those scumbags?</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH_2">No good can come from losing our forces one by one…</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="KILLS_OPPONENT">
      <BattleDialog ID="KILLS_OPPONENT_0">Hah, I left myself open more often than I wanted, too.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="KILLS_OPPONENT_1">We aren’t doing this as a joke, y’know.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="KILLS_OPPONENT_2">Wasn’t even worth dodging.</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
  </Character>
  <Character ID="Normal Enemies">
    <Type ID="START_BATTLE">
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_0">I won’t let them lay a blade on Madame Sayo.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_1">Start a fight against us Kurokumo… You’re pretty gutsy, I’ll give you that.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="START_BATTLE_2">We’ll be moving first. Be prepared, everyone…</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="BATTLE_VICTORY">
      <BattleDialog ID="BATTLE_VICTORY_0">I think we can consider it a success.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="BATTLE_VICTORY_1">Can’t wait to wash off all this blood in a nice hot bath.</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="DEATH">
      <BattleDialog ID="DEATH_0">I never thought… I’d make such a mistake…</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH">
      <BattleDialog ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH_0">R—Run, dame. Something’s not right about this place…</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH_1">Another one fell… This isn’t good.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="COLLEAGUE_DEATH_2">That sent chills down my spine. Dammit… This is scaring me.</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
    <Type ID="KILLS_OPPONENT">
      <BattleDialog ID="KILLS_OPPONENT_0">We could use a bit more caution as we proceed.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="KILLS_OPPONENT_1">You were rather skilled… But you were rash at the last moment.</BattleDialog>
      <BattleDialog ID="KILLS_OPPONENT_2">I won’t let all of you get away.</BattleDialog>
    </Type>
