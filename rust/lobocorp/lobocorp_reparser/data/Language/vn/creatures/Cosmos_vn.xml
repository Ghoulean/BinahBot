He was interested in the Fragment of the Universe since he got the job, and researched its language and behavior purely out of personal interest.&#13;&#10;And what have become of him? He finally succeeded in entering the domain of the Fragment of the Universe. But it was obvious that his small brain couldn’t withstand it.

I do not know if there’s any pattern yet, but they all show strange behaviors on the exact same day. Can you imagine three patients looking towards the sky with strange expressions, wailing strange noises in the corridor at night when everyone is asleep? I had a difficult time persuading other patients that they must have been practicing for the upcoming Halloween event. Psychiatric treatment or medicine is ineffective. "Coming, coming, still coming," this is what they always say. They also say other words that are not from any language we know. I think sending them to a general hospital was not a wise decision. &#13;&#10;- Urgent message from Doctor Alissa in 00.}
