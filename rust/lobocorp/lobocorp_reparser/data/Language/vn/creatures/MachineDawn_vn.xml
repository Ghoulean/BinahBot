      We have concluded that this abnormality possesses intelligence that is equivalent of, or advanced than human. We proceeded to give simple lectures on human language. As a result, we were able to communicate with it in some form. The followings are documented text of the conversation record. &#13;&#10;
      Q: Do your race all look the same as you?&#13;&#10;
      A: Negative. Outside. Child. See. Picture. Face. Happiness. Change. Shape.&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;
      Q: Why are you here?&#13;&#10;
      A: Knowledge. Give. Human. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;
      Q: Why are you trying to give us the knowledge?&#13;&#10;
      A: Understand. Knowledge. Moment. Know. Universe. Coincidence. Negative. No.&#13;&#10;
      The followings are the result of efforts to comprehend the abnormality’s words.&#13;&#10;
      1.	It took its form referencing to a child’s painting, and because the child looked happy, it changed the shape.&#13;&#10;
      2.	It came here to give humanity their knowledge, the moment we understand this knowledge, we will know the goal behind its action. &#13;&#10;
      3.	There are no coincidences in the universe. &#13;&#10;}

      As we taught this abnormality our language, we also gave lectures about the meanings of symbols. The abnormality had a special reaction to the symbol of heart. &#13;&#10;
      Q: (Showing the heart symbol) This is a symbol representing a heart. People think emotions come from hearts, so this symbol is often used to express one’s positive feelings to others.&#13;&#10;
      (Omitted)&#13;&#10;
      Later, we saw symbols similar to “hearts” drawn on this abnormality’s body. It is assumed that the abnormality understood the meaning of heart symbol as friendly approach. &#13;&#10;
      Considering the results of experiments, the abnormality does not possess any hostility towards humanity, rather, it is trying to be friendly. }

      {Document 1 &lt;Song of employee David&gt;&#13;&#10;
      Employee David was well-known as a person who tries to commune with “Fragment of the Universe”. His queer hobbies involved reading eccentric and suspicious books, and watching stars through a telescope. He was interested in “Fragment of the Universe” since he joined the company, and it was later found out that he had been researching the abnormality’s language and behavior pattern out of personal curiosity.  &#13;&#10;
      What happened to him is, to be direct, that he eventually succeeded to enter the plane of “Fragment of the Universe”. However, his brain was not capable of handling such burden. He had to be transferred to mental hospital. In there, he starved to death, after surviving for few days singing something unintelligible while refusing to eat. After this incident, we decided to lock away the audio file that contains the abnormality’s sound. &#13;&#10;

      …..Haven’t I told you that these people went crazy because of that abnormality? They show irregular behavior on a certain day. I am not sure there is any rule to it, though. In the night, when everyone is asleep, these three guys scream to the top of their lung, looking up to the ceiling. I went through a lot of trouble explaining it to the other patients that that was just a practice for Halloween stage. No counseling or drugs help this. They just keep repeating “It’s coming. It’s coming. It’s coming.”. Sometimes they say something different but I don’t think that language even exists in this world. I think putting them into a normal medical institute was a mistake.&#13;&#10;
