She does not trust others easily, and has an extreme fondness for battle. She is unusually uncomfortable with parts of her face and body being exposed, or looking at a mirror. Other numerous symptoms of paranoia have been observed in her behavior.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She has a strong desire to resolve emergency situations when they break out. She calls it “a request” of some kind. Since this behavior consequently helps management, the company recommended putting it to use depending on the situation.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;※ The following contains information that employees of every level should note.&#13;&#10;However, when she encounters the “Big Bad Wolf”, the situation will change drastically. She will undergo several psychological transitions including sudden depersonalization and intermittent explosive disorder. This encounter will lead to serious collateral damage, so it is advised to avoid any case where the two may face each other.}
