      An employee was sent in after covering their eyes with a thick cloth. The cloth must be made from a fine opaque material. Tests must be conducted to ensure the cloth completely blocks their vision. After entering the Abnormality's Containment Unit, they faced the direction of the Abnormality for 10 seconds. No reaction.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;Experiment D-003&gt;&#13;&#10;
      Similar to Experiment D-002, an employee was sent in with their eyes covered. The cloth was identical to the one used in D-002, but allowed the employee to discern some forms. After entering the Containment Unit of the Abnormality, they faced towards the Abnormality for 10 seconds. After 5 seconds, it aggressively approached the employee. Experiment halted.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;Experiment D-004&gt;&#13;&#10;
      This time, a blind employee^ was sent in without any covering. The employee faced the Abnormality for more than 30 seconds. There was no reaction.&#13;&#10;

      {Memo:
      When training employees who have never worked with this Abnormality before, it goes without saying, but please make sure to tell them not to look at the Abnormality directly. If someone raises doubts about this, tell them what happened to employee Yumi, who didn't follow instructions and stared directly at the Abnormality.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Memo 2:
      Employee Yumi can no longer be in charge of this Abnormality. She claims that she is under constant surveillance, but this is a preposterous accusation and we believe that she has a severe delusional disorder. Most of what she says is nonsense, but to put it simply, she claims that someone keeps watching her, whether she's eating or going to the restroom. Also, whenever she sees something like a keyhole or a crack between a door, she will become hysterical and try to seal any hole that she sees. However what's more aggravating is that her mental corruption levels read normal, which makes it difficult for us to dispose of her by the system. Please replace her soon… &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Memo 3:
      Oh, the request we made before was resolved. Employee Yumi was found in her room. She covered all the holes in her room with duct tape, including the vent. She even stabbed her eyes out with a pen. The delusional disorder seems to have been resolved as well; she's not muttering nonsense anymore... However, I have to wonder why you would want to send a blind employee to the Containment Unit again. I don't know what Experiment D-004 is about, but I don't think it will do much good...}
