      {&lt;Time for the head to burst&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To be frank, life in this place isn't so great. The company says they provide healthy hobbies, but not many people engage in that notion. Everyone looks for their own escape; be it violence, gambling, gluttony... I thought I had strength in self-control and discipline compared to others. It did help me live a smoother life. Maybe that's the reason I was assigned to Porccubus' Containment Unit.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Yes, Porccubus. Where the lowest of the low employees visit.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;I've heard a bit about what other employees do in that Containment Unit. They call it the "game of trust".&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;A game of trust, what an elegant thing to name it.}

And once I get along with it, I could acquire all of it with ease.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They said when the time comes, Porccubus will lean down so that I easily reach the thorns. It didn't take long until I got to where I could pet it.

      {(Omitted)&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When I first touched its thorns, it felt quite prickly. It felt like a giant needle penetrated my skin. Though there wasn’t any bleeding and the pain went away after a moment. Then there it was, the most intense happiness you'd ever experience.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It'd make your knees weak. When I snapped out of it, I found myself drooling.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It scared me, so I didn't go back for a while. Then, the situation gets worse. You'll get withdrawal symptoms, like retching or sweating. Different employees show different symptoms. One employee even pulled out all their teeth because they felt like bugs were crawling all over them.}

This feeling would be hundreds of times better.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;You say I'm the last employee in charge of Porccubus? That's understandable, as the brain craves more intense stimulation. At first, all I had to do was be lightly pricked by one of the thorns. Now I have to rub my whole body against it to get the same high.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;I feel like all the blood in my body will rush to my head, eventually bursting it. I’ve already imagined my head bursting thousands of times anyhow.}

It didn't eat us or bite our heads off or anything. All the corpses were smiling... happily? That's all. It just makes people smile "until death".&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;No one is to blame. We have to go through hell every day. We're just having a small taste of heaven.}
