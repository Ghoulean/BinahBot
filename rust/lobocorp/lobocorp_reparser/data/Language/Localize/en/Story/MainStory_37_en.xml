  <text id="day37_angela_2">But I think you and A might have become separate entities now.</text>
  <text id="day37_angela_3">From the moment you began to have new memories, you both started to walk different paths.</text>

  <text id="day37_angela_13">Now you are here, scrabbling over it all and climbing up.</text>
  <text id="day37_angela_14">Of course, I have kept all their data in my head, but it is not my place to share it with you.</text>
  <text id="day37_angela_15">“A machine has its own work to do.”</text>
  <text id="day37_angela_16">…That’s what you, or A, once said to me.</text>
