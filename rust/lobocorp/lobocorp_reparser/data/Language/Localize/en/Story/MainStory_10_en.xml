  <text id="day10_angela_1">Manager? Is there something wrong?</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_2">Ah, I see.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_3">Will you wait just a moment? If you cannot bear to look, you should close your eyes.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_4">There, I fixed it. There was a system error. How strange, it shouldn’t have been so easily compromised.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_5">It’s a technology originally developed during the war, now widely used for commercial purposes.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_6">It’s not that impressive of a technology, really.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_7">The human brain is fragile. Seeing such a cruel and shocking sight may unintentionally lead to a momentary “shut down” of the brain’s functions.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_8">If a manager like you were to suffer such a reaction, it would be very troublesome for me.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_9">So I installed a ‘cognition filter’ in your display.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_10">While the cognition filter functions, dead employees will look like cute dolls splattered with red paint.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_11">Abnormalities, even those who could ravage your mental state just by being in your sight, will be reduced to adorable toys on the screen of your office.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_12">Trust me, before the cognition filter was installed, many a manager lost their sanity on that seat.</text>
  <text id="day10_angela_13">I cannot allow you to join them.</text>
