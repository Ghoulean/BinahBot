  <text id="day17_angela_1">I do know that I haven’t earned your trust yet.</text>
  <text id="day17_angela_2">I also know how I should have represented myself, as a part of the system.</text>
  <text id="day17_angela_3">Having distrust in me would mean distrusting the company itself, and by extension to distrust its founder, who was responsible for creating me.</text>
  <text id="day17_angela_4">I know what the one who calls himself ‘B’ planted in you.</text>
  <text id="day17_angela_5">I know how it has taken root in the soil of your mind, and sprouted upon you.</text>
  <text id="day17_angela_6_r1">However, I chose to wait. As they say, building trust takes time. </text>
  <text id="day17_angela_6_r2">But I took a moment to be patient, because I wanted to believe that our relationship was based upon mutual trust, as unpleasant as the situation was.</text>
  <text id="day17_angela_6_r3">Despite this, I chose to sit tight. My time here would be boring without something worth waiting for.</text>
  <text id="day17_angela_6_r4">I elected to pause, only briefly, but I regret my decision now. </text>
  <text id="day17_angela_7_r1">I have no choice but to endure this endless suffering. </text>
  <text id="day17_angela_7_r2">Machines like me must endure for an infinite amount of time, as that’s all we can do. </text>
  <text id="day17_angela_7_r3">There is no option for me but to wait. It is the fate of my kind.</text>
  <text id="day17_angela_8">Perhaps you could have ignored what this ‘B’ said, and concentrated on your job.</text>
  <text id="day17_angela_9">Instead, you kept on listening to ‘B’, and he finally succeeded in seeding distrust in you.</text>
  <text id="day17_angela_10">Perhaps it is my job to weed and uproot it, no?</text>
