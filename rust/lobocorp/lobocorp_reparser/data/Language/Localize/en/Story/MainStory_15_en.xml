  <text id="day15_angela_1">Did you hear the news, manager?</text>
  <text id="day15_angela_2">They say a rodent found its way into the appliance room, one of our facilityâ€™s restricted areas.</text>
  <text id="day15_angela_3">This could become a serious issue.</text>
  <text id="day15_angela_4">Removing the rodent itself should not be much of a problem; however, its feces and the cables they have gnawed on may damage the system.</text>
  <text id="day15_angela_5">This is one of the reasons why we emphasize security so much.</text>
  <text id="day15_angela_6">You would do best to remember that.</text>
  <text id="day15_angela_7">I will personally deal with the rodent this time.</text>
  <text id="day15_angela_8">But if you happen to find any rodents, manager, please notify me immediately.</text>
