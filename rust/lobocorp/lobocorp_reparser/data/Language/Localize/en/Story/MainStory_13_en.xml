  <text id="day13_b_1">The first truth I will tell you is…</text>
  <text id="day13_b_2">Do not trust the AI at your side.</text>
  <text id="day13_b_3">In this day and age, most AI possess an intellect of at least ten regular people combined.</text>
  <text id="day13_b_4">Some can even imitate human emotions with ease.</text>
  <text id="day13_b_5">However, they can do things you are not aware of yet.</text>
  <text id="day13_b_6">For example, some AI can lie.</text>
  <text id="day13_b_7">Or rather, to be more precise, they can withhold information.</text>
  <text id="day13_b_8">If the controller of an AI has given the order to not share specific information…</text>
  <text id="day13_b_9">It has no obligation to tell the truth to anyone, other than that controller.</text>
  <text id="day13_b_10">Some advanced AI may exploit such an order to tell lies, reinterpreting the meaning of the command.</text>
  <text id="day13_b_11">I’ve programmed an AI before. Well, participated in the programming, to be exact…</text>
  <text id="day13_b_12">That’s how I know for a fact that an AI will not necessarily tell the truth.</text>
  <text id="day13_b_13">In case you doubt what I’m saying…</text>
  <text id="day13_b_14">I will send you a program for your monitor that I developed myself.</text>
  <text id="day13_b_15">This key will function like Pinocchio.</text>
  <text id="day13_b_16">The nose will lengthen. The color red means untruth.</text>
  <text id="day13_b_17">This is a test version, so it can only be used once.</text>
