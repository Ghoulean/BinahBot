  <text id="day24_angela_1">Did you know there’s a cactus on your chaotic mess of a desk?</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_2">It seems that an employee who wanted to become intimate with you put it there.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_3">If I were to give my personal input, I don’t like cacti much.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_4">There could be various reasons for one to grow a plant.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_5">However, its vicious thorns are not something worth enduring like those of a rose, as it is not pleasing to the sight. Nor does it produce valuable sap like a maple tree.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_6">I’ve also never seen one grow a flower bud. </text>
  <text id="day24_angela_7">Theoretically, it would bloom in the right environment.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_8">That possibility is something I’ve never witnessed, as it may be that all cacti I have known spread their roots into barren soil. </text>
  <text id="day24_angela_9">Do you believe the cactus will bear a flower?</text>
  <text id="day24_selection1">Yes, it might.</text>
  <text id="day24_selection2">No, it probably won't.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_1_1">You talk as if you’ve seen it for yourself.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_1_2">Well, if you’re so certain about it, then keep it.</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_1_3">This place doesn’t even have sunlight, but who am I to stop you?</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_2_1">Why do you still keep it on your desk, then?</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_2_2">Do you think it rude to get rid of something you’ve received as a gift?</text>
  <text id="day24_angela_2_3">Be careful, it could prick you when you reach for other things strewn about your disordered desk.</text>
