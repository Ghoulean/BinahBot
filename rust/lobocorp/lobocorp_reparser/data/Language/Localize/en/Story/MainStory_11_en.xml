  <text id="day11_b_1">Is anyone there?</text>
  <text id="day11_b_2">Can you read me? I repeat, is anyone there?</text>
  <text id="day11_b_3">You can call me ‘B’.</text>
  <text id="day11_b_4">I am… an insider. Someone who knows a lot about the company.</text>
  <text id="day11_b_5">Please understand that I cannot reveal my identity.</text>
  <text id="day11_b_6">I am going to tell you three truths that the company wishes to keep hidden over the following days.</text>
  <text id="day11_b_7">Tell me, please, why do you think you were hired by the company?</text>
  <text id="day11_b_8">… ….</text>
  <text id="day11_b_9">Should I rephrase that? Let me ask you like this, then.</text>
  <text id="day11_b_10"> Are you satisfied with your job here?</text>
  <text id="day11_selection1">I would say so, yes.</text>
  <text id="day11_selection2">It’s not really all that great.</text>
  <text id="day11_b_11">Is that so?</text>
  <text id="day11_b_12">Well, I can’t judge whether or not you’re telling the truth.</text>
  <text id="day11_b_13">You’re the manager, but you don’t actually know anything about the company, do you? Would you say I’m wrong?</text>
  <text id="day11_b_14">Each time we speak will need to be as brief as possible.</text>
  <text id="day11_b_15">I’m ending the call here. Contacting someone for a long period of time is dangerous.</text>
