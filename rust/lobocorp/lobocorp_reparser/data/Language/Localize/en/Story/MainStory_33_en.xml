  <text id="day33_b_1">A, why did you never go meet it even though you created it?</text>
  <text id="day33_a_1">"…. ….. …… …..."</text>
  <text id="day33_b_2">But A, surely you already know. Did you put in all that work for just a simple vending machine that dispenses soda at the press of a button?</text>
  <text id="day33_a_2">"…. ….. …… …..."</text>
  <text id="day33_b_3">At the very least, you should give it a name.</text>

  <text id="day33_b_9">It will be waiting for you. It seemed lonely. </text>
