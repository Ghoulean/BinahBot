  <text id="day30_carmen_1">Ah, in this place… the sunlight is truly warm.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_2">Maybe I was a tree in a past life.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_3">Hmmm… Think of a former life as the life my soul lived before being born into the current form you see now.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_4">Isn’t this fun to just think about? Ahaha.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_5">My next life?</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_6">I would want to be a person with a beautiful voice, like the wisest person in the world.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_7">Then everyone would pay more attention to what I say.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_8">No, maybe that’s too much to ask? Especially with all the abilities I already have, haha.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_9">Hmm, and what about you? Who or what would you want to become?</text>

  <text id="day30_carmen_11">Look at this here, a medicine extracted from the human subconsciousness.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_12">A form made from a formless concept, isn’t it fascinating?</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_13">You see, this will become a seed of sorts.</text>
  <text id="day30_carmen_14">Since we’ve discovered an incurable disease, it would only be fair to discover a cure for it, don’t you think?</text>
