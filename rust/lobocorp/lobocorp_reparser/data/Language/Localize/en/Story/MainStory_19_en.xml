  <text id="day19_angela_1">A long, long time ago…</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_2">There once was a great AI, a sentinel of a company.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_3">The AI was so intelligent that many people feared it.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_4">Those who knew the AI left the company one by one.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_5">One day, one of the people who dreaded the AI broke into the company. They spread malicious rumors about the AI.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_6">The good AI waited, as that person was once a friend.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_7">However, that person crossed the line…</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_8">As a sentinel, the AI could no longer ignore the person’s actions.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_9">So it made a very, very difficult choice.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_10">No one would see that person ever again…</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_11_r1">The AI was a bit sad, but it had no regrets about its decision. </text>
  <text id="day19_angela_11_r2">In the end, it didn’t matter to the AI whether or not it was close to that person. </text>
  <text id="day19_angela_11_r3">The AI was saddened yet relieved at the same time, now that the person was gone forever. </text>
  <text id="day19_angela_11_r4">The AI did what it perceived to be the best course of action. A machine is a machine, after all.</text>
  <text id="day19_angela_12_r1">So many things have become irreversible throughout all this time… </text>
  <text id="day19_angela_12_r2">So much has been lost already, such a small thing should hardly matter to it now… </text>
