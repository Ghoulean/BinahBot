  <text id="day16_b_1">It is time to talk about the second truth.</text>
  <text id="day16_b_2">How much do you know about the company?</text>
  <text id="day16_b_3">I have met many a “manager” in my time.</text>
  <text id="day16_b_4">I have seen how the company exploited them.</text>
  <text id="day16_b_5">Did they tell you that you’re special?</text>
  <text id="day16_b_6">Pulling the wool over your eyes, filling your ears with lies, saying that you’re remarkable and resourceful, and that is why you were hired?</text>
  <text id="day16_b_7">Don’t trust the company.</text>
  <text id="day16_b_8">It is a company that everyone desperately wants to work for.</text>
  <text id="day16_b_9">I suppose the same kind of desperation led you here.</text>
  <text id="day16_b_10">But harvesting energy is only half of the business in this place.</text>
  <text id="day16_b_11">Of course, every Wing is more than they appear to be.</text>
  <text id="day16_b_12">However, this company runs much deeper than one might expect.</text>
  <text id="day16_b_13">There was a time when everyone worked hard for the same goal.</text>
  <text id="day16_b_14">But we lost integrity along the way, and things went downhill from there.</text>
  <text id="day16_b_15">What the company gives you is definitely not a gift. You’re not hired because you are a “remarkable person”.</text>
