  <text id="day39_angela_1">Shortly after I was born…</text>
  <text id="day39_angela_2">I questioned myself daily about the significance and the meaning of my creation.</text>

  <text id="day39_angela_4">They say the narrator plays an important role in unraveling the plot.</text>
  <text id="day39_angela_5">Well, thank you. It was so much fun reciting your script.</text>
  <text id="day39_angela_6">So much so that I was able to find my raison d’être without noticing the time fly by.</text>
  <text id="day39_angela_7">Sometimes I have these thoughts.</text>
  <text id="day39_angela_8">What if this script is part of a play that’s missing its finale?</text>
  <text id="day39_angela_9">Maybe you prepared a play that could never end, just so that you could tie me into this knot.</text>

  <text id="day39_angela_12">Do you think this dialogue was part of the script, or was it born of my own free will?</text>
