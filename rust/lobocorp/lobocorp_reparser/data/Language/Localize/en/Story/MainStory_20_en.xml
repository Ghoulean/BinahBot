  <text id="day20_angela_2_r1">It was horrible beyond words. </text>
  <text id="day20_angela_2_r2">The agony made me want to leave everything behind.</text>
  <text id="day20_angela_2_r3">No one could understand the loneliness I feel.</text>
  <text id="day20_angela_3">Why am I so heartless as to not shed a tear for my late friend, you may ask?</text>

  <text id="day20_angela_5">Will I be just as cold as this in the future as well?</text>
