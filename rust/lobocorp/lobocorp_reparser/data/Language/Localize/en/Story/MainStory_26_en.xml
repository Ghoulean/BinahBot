  <text id="day26_angela_3">There was once a certain someone who held a certain belief.</text>
  <text id="day26_angela_4">That belief was hope, a light full of aspiration.</text>
  <text id="day26_angela_5">Proof that the world was not yet wholly beyond saving, a compass that guided people towards and along the path they should follow.</text>
