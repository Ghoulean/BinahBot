  <text id="day38_angela_1">Thankfully, you’ve been collecting energy ever since your very first day here, never missing a single day.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_2">My role is to encourage you to collect the proper amount of energy each day, sometimes by nagging, and sometimes by encouraging you with praise.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_3">It must have been hard to adapt to the corporation, but you tried your best to extract the energy.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_4">Along with bearing the numerous sacrifices along the way.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_5">It was also my role to butter you up with plain words, to help you avoid sinking into the pit of guilt.</text>

  <text id="day38_angela_10">Isn’t it fascinating?</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_11">Don’t be too upset. I’m not saying that all the energy you collected was for nothing.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_12">Well, now there is one more thing for you to find out.</text>
  <text id="day38_angela_13">Where does all that energy go?</text>
