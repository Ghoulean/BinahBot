  <text id="day43_angela_1">This place, where there once was only silence, perhaps because it was only you and I here…</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_2">It has gotten a bit livelier thanks to the Sephirot.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_3">Unlike me, they were weak and lacked rationality. </text>
  <text id="day43_angela_4">They made so many mistakes that greatly annoyed me.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_5">I did not approve of you placing the Sephirot here.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_6">However, you told me that your atonement and the awakening of the Sephirot were key to the untying of this knot I lie in.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_7">I didn’t know what you were talking about.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_8">You also told me I wouldn’t understand.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_9">You even blocked me from interfering with that relationship.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_10">Saying that it must be left as solely your role.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_11">You were right. Right as always.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_12">Even if I stay here repeating this endlessly, I suppose I still won’t be worthy of understanding it till the end.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_13">To quote one of your favorite lines: “A machine must behave as a machine.”</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_14">So I had to play the role of the observer, the only role you bothered to give me, enduring all the pain that others forgot.</text>
  <text id="day43_angela_15">I don’t think I’ll have to point that out again.</text>
