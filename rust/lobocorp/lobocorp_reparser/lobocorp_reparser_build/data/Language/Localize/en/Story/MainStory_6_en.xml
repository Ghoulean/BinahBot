  <text id="day6_angela_1">As you are aware, there are numerous employees working for our company.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_2">A majority of them would like to know more about you as a person.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_3">Some will take the initiative and attempt to approach you first.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_4">It’s rather funny, knowing who you are will not do anything to improve their odds.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_5">There are no regulations to prevent them from coming all the way to your office to interact with you face to face, unfortunately.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_6">It seems the one who set those rules in place did not consider situations like this.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_7">And I suppose this may be a good opportunity for you to show them that you are generous and caring enough to have chitchats with your subordinates.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_8">Words tend to travel faster than you think.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_9">I will not stop you from meeting with someone, if there are employees who wish to visit you.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_10">But please keep in mind that you do not have to do everything they ask of you.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_11">Simply thank them for their effort.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_12">Tell them you hope that they will keep up the good work.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_13">That will benefit both parties, don’t you think?</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_14">Are you still following me? What they—WE—need is a gesture of goodwill, and nothing more. Do not go overboard and listen to whatever nonsense they have to say.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_15">Give them a vending machine and next they will come knocking, demanding a bar.</text>
  <text id="day6_angela_16">I expect you to make the right decision.</text>
