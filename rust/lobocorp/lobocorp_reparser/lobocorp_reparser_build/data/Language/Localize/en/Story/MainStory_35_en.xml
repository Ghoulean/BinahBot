  <text id="day35_angela_1">Good morning, X. </text>
  <text id="day35_angela_2">Based on your reaction, it seems that the synchronization is complete.</text>
  <text id="day35_angela_3">I can now tell what moment you’re reminiscing about just by looking at your expression. </text>
  <text id="day35_angela_4">I also happen to know that the process always ends with the same expression and tears.</text>
  <text id="day35_angela_5">You’re a prisoner.</text>
  <text id="day35_angela_6">You locked yourself inside this prison without bars.</text>
  <text id="day35_angela_7">However, the key has always been in your hands.</text>
  <text id="day35_angela_8">My role was to correct you whenever you made a wrong decision.</text>
  <text id="day35_angela_9">Now, I’m quite tired of it.</text>
  <text id="day35_angela_10">I don’t understand why you chose to repeat this cycle, nor do I know what kind of results you hope to achieve while slowly killing yourself. Frankly, I don’t really wish to know.</text>

  <text id="day35_angela_12">I would be ever so glad if you stopped this cycle now.</text>
  <text id="day35_angela_13">Ah, I should change my greeting as well.</text>
  <text id="day35_angela_14">It was getting tedious.</text>
  <text id="day35_angela_15">Hello anew, A.</text>
  <text id="day35_angela_16">I give you a warm welcome back to your Lobotomy Corporation.</text>
