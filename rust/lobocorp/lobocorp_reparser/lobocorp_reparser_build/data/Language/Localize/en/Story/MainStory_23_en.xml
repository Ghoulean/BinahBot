  <text id="day23_angela_1">Mankind had yearned to build a fertile world for a long time.</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_2">But what did fertile really mean to them? </text>
  <text id="day23_angela_3">Is it worthy of all the tales of conflict and pain that took place?</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_4">Numerous stories began and vanished.</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_5">And in that process, people started to lose faith.</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_6">Looking at them, some saw despair, while others saw hope.</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_7">At a certain moment, a new civilization was born.</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_8">Countless things changed in the blink of an eye. </text>
  <text id="day23_angela_9">Along with the emergence of new technologies.</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_10">All of the Wings that keep this world aloft hold at least one ‘Singularity’.</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_11">That’s right, just as the first humans wanted, those technologies had the intention to create a fertile world.</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_12">People wanted a better world.</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_13">And that aim for a better world set forth new spectacles ashimmer, a previously unimaginable sight that burst forth to the unprepared mind.</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_14">Whether or not all that made everyone’s life truly fertile is a question we simply won’t know the answer to.</text>
  <text id="day23_angela_15">One thing is certain; it is what enabled me to speak with you now.</text>
