  <text id="day32_angela_2">They needed a hero, but ended up beheading said hero with their own hands.</text>
  <text id="day32_angela_3">A lot of things happened, and a lot of things changed.</text>
  <text id="day32_angela_4">A changed himself from a healer to a creator.</text>
  <text id="day32_angela_5">The old promises he had made with her sustained him evanescently, but in a world without her, they ultimately became obsolete. </text>
  <text id="day32_angela_6">Various sins sprung up from his arrogance, one by one.</text>
  <text id="day32_angela_7">And A changed, very slowly.</text>
  <text id="day32_angela_8">He became enchanted by the shadows he had created.</text>
  <text id="day32_angela_9">The plan to discover the disease of mankind became a relic of the past.</text>
  <text id="day32_angela_10">He became skeptical of man, including himself.</text>
  <text id="day32_angela_11">A started looking for something that would guide him without turning against him.</text>

  <text id="day32_angela_15">Machines, which A loathed deeply, became essential to him.</text>

  <text id="day32_angela_17">Angelos.</text>
  <text id="day32_angela_18">That was how I was born. </text>
