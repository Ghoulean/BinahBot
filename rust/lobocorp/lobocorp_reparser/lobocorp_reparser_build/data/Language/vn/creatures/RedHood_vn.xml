Rumor says her hood used to be white, but became red after being soaked in blood for countless times. → It turned out to be not true. Fix this, Michael! &#13;&#10; Before coming to this facility, she was a mercenary, wandering around without residence. She does not trust others well, and has extreme fondness for battles. She is unusually uncomfortable with her part of flesh being exposed, and looking at mirror. Also, numerous symptoms of paranoid have been observed in her behaviors. &#13;&#10; She has strong desire to resolve emergency situations if one ever breaks out. She says it’s “a contract”. Since this behavior consequently helps the management process, the company recommended putting it to use.&#13;&#10;※ The followings contain must-read for employees in all class.&#13;&#10;If she faces “Big and Might be bad Wolf”, she goes out of control. She will undergo extreme shift in personality, embitterment disorder, and other psychologically dangerous disorders which result in serious collateral damage. Thus, extreme caution is advised when working on Little Red Riding Hooded Mercenary. }
