A conductor’s skills can be determined within 5 minutes. The moment the conductor opens the score, its eyes, behavior, and atmosphere will be judged by the musicians. The musicians will then decide if the conductor is worthy to lead them. Without their harmony and cooperation, the music’s true message cannot be expressed. Therefore the conductor must maintain superb command, leadership, and have excellent power of persuasion…. (Omitted) &gt;}
